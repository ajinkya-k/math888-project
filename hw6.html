# Conclusion and Future Work

My project was motivated by a very broad question: <ins>"What is the effect of changing the social network on the outcomes for the individuals in that social network?"</ins>
However, I showed that the number of potential outcomes is so large that this general problem is interminably difficult.
Therefore, I tackle a circumscribed version of the problem. Instead of treating the entire network as the treatment, I selected a _focal node_ in the network and considered the effect of being connected to the focal node, i.e. I consider a node to be "treated" if it is connected to the focal node and "untreated" if it is not.

In the [identification section](hw3.html), I showed that the average effect of being connected to the focal node can be identified under a network version of the ignorability condition.
In the [estimation section](hw4.html) I developed an inverse propensity score estimator for the average connection effect.
This required using a propensity score estimation algorithm that accounts for the network: `flexBART`.
Finally, I considered the necessity and reach of the assumptions that I made for driving identification (see [Sensitivity Analysis](hw5.html)).

This project was theoretical in nature, and I was not able to do simulations to demonstrate the method.
I intend to continue working on this problem.
The use of a network based propensity score is possibly the biggest limitation of this project. 
Network propensity score estimation is a genuinely difficult problem and even `flexBART` may not be able to do well if the dataset is small.
I hope to gauge this in a simulation study. 
When fully fleshed out, I think this method can be used in many social science applications. For example:

- Does being friends with a well-connected individual increase your income prospects?
- Do "community leaders" really affect their communities social  attitudes? 
- Does having gay acquaintances affect attitudes towards same-sex marriage legalization?

All of these examples are relevant for public policy (e.g. should vaccines be made available at community centers and [barber shops](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/upshot/what-barbershops-can-teach-about-delivering-health-care.html)). 
Thus, the problem I tackled in my project is relevant, even though it is a very circumscribed version of the question that I was initially interested in.
