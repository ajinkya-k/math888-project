I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at The University of Wisconsin -- Madison, advised by [Prof. Sameer Deshpande](https://skdeshpande91.github.io/). 
I am pursuing research in causal inference, machine learning and decision making. 
Currently, my work focuses on heterogenous treatment effect estimation, and causal inference for social networks.
Prior to joining UW-Madison, I graduated with a MS in Economics and Computation at Duke University (2020). For my CV click [here](cv.html).

I credit my interest in causal inference to my friend and old room-mate [Harsh Parikh](https://sites.google.com/view/harshparikh/). 
My background in economics and computer science made me excited about
automated decision making and decision support. 
Any decision making process relies on an understanding of the cause and effects of things and actions. 
Moreover, human intuition though a beautiful thing a) is fallible and b) doesn't scale.
So inferring causal relationships from large datasets is crucial for understand decision making involving complex domains.

Cue mandatory disclaimer about correlation and causation:
